/Project Overview: System Setup Automation
//Introduction
This project involved automating system setup by creating scripts that streamline the installation of packages, configuration of applications, and user management. The main goal was to write scripts that save time and reduce the hassle of setting up new systems from scratch. We divided the project into two parts: Project 1 focuses on setting up system configurations (including symlinks and package installations), while Project 2 focuses on creating users for the system.
///Tools & Technologies Used:
Bash scripting
Git for version control
Linux terminal commands
sudo privileges for installation tasks
//Project 1: System Configuration Automation

create_symlinks.sh
This script was responsible for creating symbolic links (symlinks) for configuration files. Symlinks are useful for linking configuration files from a centralized repository to the home directories, ensuring all system configurations are synchronized and updated across systems. In this project, symlinks were created for files like .bashrc, .tmux.conf, and .kakrc.

///Key Commands:
bash
Copy code
ln -s /path/to/config_file ~/.config
This command creates a symlink for a configuration file from the /path/to/config_file to ~/.config, linking the configuration file into the systemâ€™s home directory.

install_packages.sh
This script installs the necessary packages for the system. It reads a list of required packages (stored in packages.txt) and installs them using the package manager (sudo pacman for Arch Linux). This step ensures all the software tools required for the setup are ready to use.

///Key Commands:
bash
Copy code
sudo pacman -S --noconfirm $(cat packages.txt)
This command reads the list of packages from packages.txt and installs them without asking for confirmation for each package.

setup_system.sh
This is the main script that ties everything together. It calls the previous two scripts (create_symlinks.sh and install_packages.sh) to set up the system. This script ensures that the user can execute everything in one go, simplifying the setup process.

///Key Commands:
bash
Copy code
./install_packages.sh
./create_symlinks.sh
By running both scripts, the system will first have all the required software installed and then configure the system with the right symlinks.
//Project 2: User Creation
create_user.sh
In this part of the project, the goal was to automate user creation on a new system. This script takes care of adding new users, setting up their home directories, and applying necessary configurations for the user.
///Key Commands:
bash
Copy code
sudo useradd -m -G wheel -s /bin/bash $username
sudo passwd $username
The useradd command creates a new user and assigns them to the appropriate group (wheel for sudo access). The passwd command sets the user's password.
//Summary
Throughout the project, we automated essential system setup tasks by writing scripts that install packages, configure applications, and create users. This saves a lot of time and ensures consistency across new systems. Each script focused on one specific task, and by combining them, we created a seamless process for setting up a new system. This project demonstrated the power of scripting in automating repetitive tasks and improving efficiency.
By using version control (Git), we also ensured that our scripts were easily trackable and could be shared with others. This approach is especially useful when setting up multiple machines or configuring systems with the same requirements.
